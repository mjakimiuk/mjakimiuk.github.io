You need to start somewhere, right? This is the first post starting a series of Python Tutorials using different Python modules with the help of Google Colab. Colab allows you to write and execute Python code right in your browser, which is a super convenient way to learn/play/work with Python. I just love this service! You only need a browser and internet connection to be able to use its full potential.
