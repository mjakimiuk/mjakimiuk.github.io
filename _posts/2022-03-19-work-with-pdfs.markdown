In this tutorial we will work with Python module called [PyPDF2]. You can access it on my [GitHub repository] or with this link [notebook]. The notebook serves as a tutorial and ready to use example. I am trying to write posts here as short as possible and explain everything directly in the notebook. 


[PyPDF2]: https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/
